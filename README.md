# heartless-gaming-temp

The main site over at [heartless-gaming/heartlessgaming.com](https://github.com/heartless-gaming/heartlessgaming.com) is being developped and shall not be ready soon.

Meanwhile why not set up a temporary page using fun stuff like **Flexbox**, **[Knacss](https://github.com/alsacreations/KNACSS)**, **BEM**, **npm scripts**.

This page as been done in 3hours in *almost* complete offline mode. thanks to offline docs and Sublime wizardry.

Thanks to the openess of the web and the people contributing to it.
